/*********************************************************************
This is the main thread for placing Arduino Sketch code to run on Renesas AE Cloud2 S5D9 board

Created on: September 17, 2018
First Released on: March 19, 2019
Author: Michael Li (michael.li@miketechuniverse.com)

An Arduino sketch is placed inside the section that is defined by two comment lines.  The section has the
example of setup() and loop() functions.   You can replace them with your example code.  It is very simple.
Most common functions like Serial and Wire functions are supported except of the SPI functions which need to
be modified to run.
